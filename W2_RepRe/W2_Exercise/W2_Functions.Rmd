# Automating data analysis with functions


Sometimes we have a set of analyses that needs to be done multiple times. Instead of a copy & paste approach, we can write a `function()` 

![automation](figs/geeks.png)


## Anatomy of a function 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
FunctionName <- function(arguement1, arguement2, ...){
  #some analysis
  return(outputOfFunction)
}

```


## Function Names

Function names should...

* be verbs describing what the function will do. 
* use CamelCaseNaming 

*GOOD:* CalculateAvgClicks  
*BAD:* calculate_avg_clicks , calculateAvgClicks 

## Practice 

*scenario:* In addition to the GMPD, there are also parasite datasets for cetaceans and fish among others. They all follow the same format and column naming system. You've been asked to continue exploring which groups are sickest (Q1) using these additional datasets. 

*task:* Write a function that will automate these calculations for each dataset. 

*Step 1.* Determine what the function should do. Maybe try out the analysis on a sample dataset

  * we have code that will do this for the `gmp` dataset

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
gmp <- read_csv("data/GMPD_main.csv")

gmp %>%
  drop_na(Prevalence) %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  summarise(MeanPrev = mean(Prevalence), SdErrPrev = sd(Prevalence)/sqrt(n()))
```

*Step 2.* Decide how to generalize the code

  * What names will change with each dataset? 
  * What will stay the same? 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
gmp %>%
  drop_na(Prevalence) %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  summarise(MeanPrev = mean(Prevalence), SdErrPrev = sd(Prevalence)/sqrt(n()))
```

From the information in the scenario, we know that the column names will not change. This means that lines 69 through 71 are already general. The dataset name will change since it is not possible to have multiple dataset objects with the same name. We might want to use a more generic name than `gmp` for the dataset name. Let's use `dataset`.

*Step 3.* Put into function format

We have already decided what the analysis should be, now we have 2 more decisions to make:

1. What should we name the function (see rules above)
2. What arguements does the function need.

The arguements are what is fed into the function. In this case, we need to tell the function which dataset to feed into the analysis pipeline. 

Modify the function skeleton below to make a working function

```{r}
 InformativeName <- function(agr1, arg2, ...){
  ## analysis
 }

```

*Step 4.* Try it out
  Once you've writen your function, you'll need to load it into the environment by executing the code. Then you can call that analysis just like the other functions we've been using!

```{r}
#load function into environment
 PrevByHostGroup<- function(dataset){
  dataset %>%
    drop_na(Prevalence) %>%
    group_by(Group) %>%
    summarise(MeanPrev = mean(Prevalence), SdErrPrev = sd(Prevalence)/sqrt(n()))
 }

#check to make sure it works. 
PrevByHostGroup(gmp)
```

## Tidyverse Challenge

 Modify the `PrevByHostGroup()` function so that the mean prevalence is calculated for each host group and parasite type. 
 
```{r}
 PrevByParType <- function(dataset){
  dataset %>%
    # calculate mean prevalence for host group and parasite type   
}

# uncomment following line to test function
# PrevByParType(gmp)
```


# Maintaining a clean workflow 

Functions are useful for repeative tasks. Sometimes we might even want to use them in different `.Rmd` files. We *could* copy & paste the functions between `.Rmd` files. This is not a good practice because:

- C&P might introduce transcription errors in your functions
- Errors in the function have to be changed in *each* location that it has been copied to. 

An alternative is creating a script and storing it in the `scripts/` folder of your working directory. Scripts have a `.R` file extension, and are a way to reference more stable code without actually interacting with the stable code. Let's make a script for the `PrevByHostGroup()` function. 

**Making a Script:**

1. Create a `.R` file 
2. Make some comments at the start of the file, write your functions
    - *Note:* There is some bad advice about scripts you might come across. Never start a script by cleaning the environmet (`rm(list = ls())`) or by setting the working director (`setwd()`)
    - Using R projects means that you don't have to set working directories. 
3. Save file in scripts directory with an informative name

**Sourcing a script**

The functions in the script are loaded into the `R` environment by using the `source()` command. Let's try it out. 

For the sake of this demonstration, let's start with a fresh session of `R` by clicking on Session > Restart R. You'll notice the Enviornment tab is now empty. 


```{r source script}
# Uncomment command, and add relative path to script
# source()

```

Is the `PrevByHostGroup()` function in your environment? What when you type `PrevByHostGroup` into the console? What about `PrevByHostGroup()`?
