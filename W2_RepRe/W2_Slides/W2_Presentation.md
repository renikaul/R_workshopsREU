1. What is Reproducibe Research (RR)? 
========================================================

**Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health:**

Reproducible Research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.

What is reproducible research? 
========================================================
Three R's: Replication, repeatability, and reproducibility
  
**Replication** concerns the number of data points (observations, study subjects, etc.) and establishes the generality of the observed finding to a study population.
  
**Repeatability** concerns the ability to arrive at the same findings when a study is repeated and establishes the generality of the observed finding to other study populations or systems.

**Reproducibility** concerns the reliability of the logic that leads from data to conclusions -- that is, the *data analysis*. It would seem that reproducibility is an essential ingredient of scientific knowledge. But, as data workflow become more and more complicated they also bring more subjective decision-making by the data analyst, more computations, and more opportunities for error.

Why should research be made reproducible?
========================================================
**Four public virtues and one private one**

- Enables readers to develop a complete and exact understanding of methods
- Enables error detection and correction 
- Facilitates critique
- Enables extension and advancement
- Saves time (private)

How can research be made reproducible?
========================================================

**Three concepts**

- *Workflow/Dataflow* is made reproducible by file organization and coding practices
- *Literate statistical programming* is incorporated into research by blending computer code and with natural language explanations
- *Science archive* must be used for public virtures to be realized 

Workflow is...
========================================================  

the idea that data analysis may be viewed as a repeatable pattern of computational activities. If these activities are truly repeatable and truly computational, then they may be encoded in an algorithm (programming). This principle of repeatable computation is the key to reproducible research. In reproducible research, a computer program is written to perform an analysis.

 Where is the 'Why'? 
========================================================

Within your code your comments and longer commentary should include the *why* instead of the what or how.  

Is this an example of good commenting the **why**?


```r
passengers %>% # start with Titanic passengers data set
  filter(Sex == "male") %>% # pull out male passengers
  ggplot(aes(x= Age, y =Fare)) + # plot age on x axis and fare on y axis
  geom_point() # plot the data as points
```

 Commenting the "Why"? 
========================================================

An example of better comments with commentary: 

> I hypothesize that older men will pay a higher fare because they have had more time to accumulate more wealth. The first step of testing this hypothesis is to determine if there is a possitive correlation between age and fare for male passengers.

```r
# create a plot to see how male passengers' age correlated with the fare they paid. 
passengers %>% 
  filter(Sex == "male") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= Age, y =Fare)) + 
  geom_point() 
```


2. Review of tidyverse
========================================================  
left: 50%

- The tidyverse is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share common design. 
- Unique syntax used pipes (`%>%`) to connect data (object) to verbs (functions).

tidyverse package
========================================================  
The tidyverse package is designed to make it easy to install and load core packages from the `tidyverse` in a single command. Last workshop we transformed and visualized data, this time we will also incorporate rmarkdown. 

![tidy verse package](figs/tidyverse.png)



======================================================== 

Open `W2_Exercise.Rmd` by double clicking "W2_Exercise.Rproj"
 to practice commenting and literate programming

Questions to reflect on...
======================================================== 
1. What did you include in your commentary? in comments? why? 
1. What was challenging about documenting the other group's work? 
2. How does your document compare to other group members? Did you include similar information? 
3. What changes (if any) did you make to the markdown code to format the html output?

3. Creating a R project
========================================================
Now, we are going explore data starting from scratch. Let's start a new project.

Some great reasons to use projects at http://bit.ly/WhyUseProjects

Exploring the Global Mammal Parasite Database
========================================================

It is now your turn to start a R project to explore the Global Mammal Parasite Database (GMPD).

1. Start a new project from a new directory called GMPD
2. Move the GMPD data into the appropriate location

 ![workflow](figs/directory_org.png)
 
**Organization is key**

What is the Global Mammal Parasite Database? 
========================================================

Take the next few minutes to review:

* Check out the dataset publication at http://bit.ly/RworkshopGMPD
* Read the abstract of the `metadata.pdf` file 
* Read about the file formats on page 14-19
* Open the data files, match the column titles to the metadata explaination  


You've been tasked to explore the data set
========================================================

Your research group is particularly interested in: 

1. Which of the 3 groups (carnivores, primates, or ungulates) are sickest? *(hint: use the main.csv file)*
2. Are parasites transmitted by vectors also likely to have complex life cycles compared to non-vectored parasites? *(hint: use the traits.csv file)*  

Be sure to use comments and commentary to explain your process.


Exploring the Global Mammal Parasite Database
========================================================

You might start by loading the needed packages and data. 


```r
library(tidyverse)
gmp <- read_csv("data/GMPD_main.csv")
```

* use the cheat sheets, `W1_exercise.Rmd` and each other for help! 

Q1. Which group is sicker? 
========================================================

  > I'm using mean prevalence as a measurement of health. The mean prevalence is calculated for all reported parasites, ignoring parasite type. This might be an assumption to explore later. The sample sizes are very different so I will also calculate standard error to use when comparing the mean values.  


```r
gmp %>%
  drop_na(Prevalence) %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  summarise(MeanPrev = mean(Prevalence), SdErrPrev = sd(Prevalence)/sqrt(n())) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Group, y = MeanPrev)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = MeanPrev-SdErrPrev, ymax = MeanPrev+SdErrPrev), width = 0.2)
```

*what is the output of this code chunk?*


========================================================

```r
gmp %>%
  drop_na(Prevalence) %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  summarise(MeanPrev = mean(Prevalence), SdErrPrev = sd(Prevalence)/sqrt(n())) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Group, y = MeanPrev)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = MeanPrev-SdErrPrev, ymax = MeanPrev+SdErrPrev), width=0.2)
```

Q2. Do vectored parasites also have intermediate hosts? 
========================================================

> I am interested in the proportion of parasites with complex life histories or intermediate hosts. I think that vectored parasites as compared to non-vectored parasites are more likely to have an intermediate host. For the first pass, I want to visualize the number of vectored parasites. 


```r
gmpTraits <- read_csv("data/GMPD_parasite_traits.csv")

gmpTraits %>%
  mutate(vector = ifelse(vector == 0, "No", "Yes")) %>%
  mutate(intermediate = ifelse(intermediate == 0, "No", "Yes")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = vector, fill = intermediate)) +
  geom_bar()
```

*what happens if an `ifelse` statement isn't used?*

Q2. Do vectored parasites also have intermediate hosts? 
========================================================




```r
gmpTraits %>% mutate(vector = ifelse(vector == 0, "No", "Yes")) %>% mutate(intermediate = ifelse(intermediate == 
    0, "No", "Yes")) %>% ggplot(aes(x = vector, fill = intermediate)) + geom_bar()
```

4. Automating data analysis with functions
========================================================

Sometimes we have a set of analyses that needs to be done multiple times. Instead of a copy & paste approach, we can write a `function()` 

![automation](figs/geeks2.png)

Anatomy of a function 
========================================================



```r
FunctionName <- function(arguement1, arguement2, ...){
  #some analysis
  return(outputOfFunction)
}
```


Function Names
========================================================
Function names should...

* be verbs describing what the function will do. 
* use CamelCaseNaming 

*GOOD:* CalculateAvgClicks  
*BAD:* calculate_avg_clicks , calculateAvgClicks 

An Example
========================================================

Move `W2_Functions.Rmd` from the W2_Exercise folder into your GMPD folder containing the `GMPD.Rproj`

Open the `.Rmd` once it is in the correct location. 

An Example
========================================================

*scenario:* In addition to the GMPD, there are also parasite datasets for cetaceans and fish among others. They all follow the same format and column naming system. You've been asked to continue exploring which groups are sickest (Q1) using these additional datasets. 

*task:* Write a function that will automate these calculations for each dataset. 

An Example
========================================================

*scenario:* In addition to the GMPD, there are also parasite datasets for cetaceans and fish among others. They all follow the same format and column naming system. You've been asked to continue exploring which groups are sickest (Q1) using these additional datasets. 

*task:* Write a function that will automate these calculations for each dataset. 

*step 1:* Determine what the function should do. Maybe try out the analysis on a sample dataset


Step 1. Sketching out the function analysis
========================================================
  * we have code that will do this for the `gmp` dataset


```r
gmp %>%
  drop_na(Prevalence) %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  summarise(MeanPrev = mean(Prevalence), SdErrPrev = sd(Prevalence)/sqrt(n()))
```

```
# A tibble: 3 x 3
  Group      MeanPrev SdErrPrev
  <chr>         <dbl>     <dbl>
1 carnivores    0.388   0.0141 
2 primates      0.328   0.00534
3 ungulates     0.500   0.00706
```

Step 2. Decide how to generalize the code
========================================================
  * What names will change with each dataset? 
  * What will stay the same? 


```r
gmp %>%
  drop_na(Prevalence) %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  summarise(MeanPrev = mean(Prevalence), SdErrPrev = sd(Prevalence)/sqrt(n()))
```

Step 3. Put into function format
========================================================
 

```r
 PrevByParType<- function(dataset){
  dataset %>%
    drop_na(Prevalence) %>%
    group_by(Group) %>%
    summarise(MeanPrev = mean(Prevalence), SdErrPrev = sd(Prevalence)/sqrt(n()))
 }
```

Step 4. Try it out
========================================================
 

```r
 PrevByParType<- function(dataset){
  dataset %>%
    drop_na(Prevalence) %>%
    group_by(Group) %>%
    summarise(MeanPrev = mean(Prevalence), SdErrPrev = sd(Prevalence)/sqrt(n()))
 }

PrevByParType(gmp)
```

```
# A tibble: 3 x 3
  Group      MeanPrev SdErrPrev
  <chr>         <dbl>     <dbl>
1 carnivores    0.388   0.0141 
2 primates      0.328   0.00534
3 ungulates     0.500   0.00706
```

Tidyverse Challenge
========================================================
 Modify this function so that the mean prevalence is calculated for each parasite type. 
 

```r
 PrevByParType<- function(dataset){
  dataset %>%
    drop_na(Prevalence) %>%
    group_by(Group) %>%
    summarise(MeanPrev = mean(Prevalence), SdErrPrev = sd(Prevalence)/sqrt(n()))
 }
```

Returning to RR
========================================================  
**Dataflow is the idea that when a variable changes, downstream computations affected by that variable should change as well.**

So in this case, we've written a function that can take in different datasets or updated versions and adjust the output atuomatically*

*as long as the column names are consistent.
