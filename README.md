# R_workshopsREU
Series of workshops used to introduce R to participants of the Population Biology of Infectious Disease 

## Workshop 1: Introduction to R, Rstudio and tidyverse
  1. What is the goal of these workshops? (John)
  2. Workshop format and expectations
  3. What is `R` and how is it used for research?
  4.  What  RStudio
      - list at least 3 reasons R/RStudio is a useful research tool 
      - describe CRAN's function
      - install a package
      - create a variable in R
      - Interface with Rstudio
  5. Getting the terminology
  6.  Data Types
      - assigning objects
      - data structure and syntax
      - troubleshooting through Rstudio
      - data subsetting
  7.  Best practices
  8.  Writing functions 
      - function syntax
      - control statements
      - logic statements 
  9. What to do when you are stuck    
## Workshop 2: Reproducible research with R
  1. Review making a script
  2. Function swap
  3. Reproducible research
  4.  Manipulating and exploring Data  
      - loading data 
      - calculate simple stats in base `R`
      - plot function in base `R`

      which will require the following skills already covered:
       - logic statements
       - manipulating data  
       - assigning an object


## Workshop 3: Simulating infectious diseases with R
 8.  Simulating Data
        - simulating data of discrete model
        - simulating data of continuous model
        
      which will require the following skills already covered:

        - function syntax
        - data structure 
        - assigning an object
        - plotting in base `R`
        - plotting in ggplot
        - manipulating data  

## Workshop 4: Data visualization with R
Collaborative plotting
 7.  Data Visualization
      - plotting in base R
      - plotting in ggplot
      - spatial data
