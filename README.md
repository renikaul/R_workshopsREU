# R_workshopsREU
Series of workshops used to introduce R to participants of the Population Biology of Infectious Disease 

## Workshop 1: Introduction to R, Rstudio using tidyverse
  	0. Why is R programming a useful skill? (John)
  	0. Workshop format and expectations
  	1.  What is R and RStudio
      - list at least 3 reasons R/RStudio is a useful research tool 
      - describe CRAN's function
      - install a package
      - create a variable in R
      - Interface with Rstudio
  	2. Introduction to R with tidyverse code along
  	3. How to troubleshoot in R
  	4. Exploring data further in groups

## Workshop 2: Reproducible research with RStudio
	1. Introduction to reproductive research
		- starting/working in R projects
    	- good file organization  	
    	- good commenting  "the why, not the how"
    	- good commentary
    	- using code chunks
    	- writing a script
  	2. Review of tidyverse with exercise
  		- edit Exploring further from Wksp 1 to adhere to best practices
    	3. Exploring data using reproducible research practices
 		- explore the data using the reproducible workflow
    	- new skills:
    		- ~class str()~
    		- writing functions
    		- ~iterating~ 
    	- practice old skills:
    		- tidyverse
    		- Rproject
		- logic statements (ifelse)

      - data subsetting
  7.  Best practices
  8.  Writing functions 
      - function syntax
      - control statements
      - logic statements 
  9. What to do when you are stuck       
 

  
  1. Review making a script
  2. Function swap
  3. Reproducible research
  4.  Manipulating and exploring Data  
      - loading data 
      - calculate simple stats in base `R`
      - plot function in base `R`

      which will require the following skills already covered:
       - logic statements
       - manipulating data  
       - assigning an object
       
       
        8.  Simulating Data
        - simulating data of discrete model
        - simulating data of continuous model
        
      which will require the following skills already covered:

        - function syntax
        - data structure 
        - assigning an object
        - plotting in base `R`
        - plotting in ggplot
        - manipulating data
