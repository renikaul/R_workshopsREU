Workshop Goals 
========================================================
left:65%
**The workshop series** consists of four half day workshops each focusing on a different part of the research process
- Introduction to `R` (Today)
- Reproducible research (May 30; Robbie Richards)
- Simulating infectious diseases  (June4; John Vinson)
- Visualizing data (June 6; Michelle Evans)

  5. Wrap Up 



1. What is R and RStudio? 
========================================================
left: 50%
![R logo](figs/Rlogo.svg)

* `R` is a free, open source programming language with a pre-set functionality (base `R`) 
* Functionality is extented by `R` packages which are collections of functions and data sets developed by the community.

***
![RStudio logo](figs/RStudio-Logo.png)

* RStudio is a software program that makes `R` programming easier by:
  - write and test code efficiently
  - orginizing files into projects
  - intergrating different programming lanuguages (RMarkdown, Latex, etc.)
   

RStudio 
========================================================

Let's open today's exercise by clicking on W1_Exercise.Rproj in the W1_Exercise folder. 

RStudio should automatically open from here. 

RStudio 
========================================================

2. Introduction to tidyverse
========================================================  
left: 50%

- The tidyverse is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share common design. 
- Unique syntax used pipes (`%>%`) to connect data (object) to verbs (functions).

tidyverse package
========================================================  
The tidyverse package is designed to make it easy to install and load core packages from the `tidyverse` in a single command.

![tidy verse package](figs/tidyverse.png)


Install tidyverse package
======================================================== 
- We need to install the `tidyverse` package. This can be done by clicking on buttons in Rstudio or from the console using `install.packages()`
- Install the package by running line 21 of the `W1_Exercise.Rmd` file

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install all the packages in the tidyverse
install.packages("tidyverse") 
```


Load tidyverse package
======================================================== 
- Once a package is installed, we need to load it during our current R session. 
- This is done using `library()`.
- How should this code be altered to load the tidyverse library? 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# load tidyverse library
library()
```


======================================================== 

Switch over to `W1_Exercise.Rmd`

3. How to get unstuck: functions
========================================================
left: 35%
- Every function has a help page 
- `?function()` to access

How to get unstuck: packages
========================================================
left: 50%
* Packages have a vignette and/or reference manual on [cran.r-project.org](cran.r-project.org)

* People often make their own tutorials too

How to get unstuck: error messages
========================================================

![error](figs/error_msg.png)

First, try to understand the error message. It can be very helpful.

 - But sometimes, the messages is cryptic. So use google!

4. Exploring further
========================================================
Let's work in small groups (max [X])

- Develop a question about that can be answered with this data
- Decide on the needed verbs, and order
- Write the code in the final code chunck of the `W1_Exercise.Rmd` file

More instructions in the file.

*using*
 - `dplyr` package
    -   filter, arrange...
