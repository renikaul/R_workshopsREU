The goal of these workshops are for students to develop R programming skills that they will use during the REU by jumping straight into those tasks. The design will show students the value of this skill and encourage maintained engagement. However, this approach priorizes task completion over technical knowledge which will hopefully be filled in over time and as needed.     

Please take breaks as needed, some are just built in for reminders. 
Each workshop is broken down into 3 parts: 1. Short lecture, 2. Code Along or demonstration of a skill, and 3. Application of those skills.  

Short Lecture: 
You've been provided HTML slides that will help you introduce the topic. There are some slides that will require edits from you (ie. contact information, how you use R in your work). Specific items are noted with `[INSERT INFO]' notation. 

The slides were created with RStudio .Rpres feature. Once you have made your edits, save the presentation as a html for the workshop. See
https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations for more details. 

Feel free to edit the material as needed, but please still cover the information since each workshop will build on previously covered skills. 


See W1_Pres_Comments.txt for slide specific comments. 

Code-Along:
The code along file is the W1_Exercise.Rmd with a solutions file (W1_Exercise_soln.Rmd or code chunks only: W1_Exercise_soln.R). It might be easiest to print off the .R to reference during the code along.   
I have modified the Data Camp's  Introduction to tidyverse live code-along held on Facebook live April 5th, 2018. The code-along was 1 hour. The video is broken into 2 parts. It might be help watch the video to see how this type of instruction works.

I think this type of instruction works best when the leader takes the time to read the bits in between the code chunks and keeps a relatively moderate pace. I have built in little reflection sections to allow students to catch up as needed. 
It is also important to set up your screen to maximize the view of previously completed lines while making sure students can still see what is currently being typed. The bottom of the projector screen is too low to be seen from the back of the computer lab. You may also want to make sure that monitors not in use are stored under the table. 

The dataset defines gender as a binary. Be sensitive to this. 

See W1_Exercise_soln.R for chunck specific comments. 

Application of skills: 
This is to be completed as a group at the end of the W1_Exercise.Rmd. The majority of your time will be spent working with groups. Engage students and groups who seem to be withdrawing from the activity. Encourage them to look at the cheatsheets and other references. This is an opportunity for them to develop trouble shooting skills, and ownership of a product. 

You should check in with groups early in the process to make sure the question is appropriately challenging and answerable given the dataset. This isn't a skill that will be explicitly covered in these workshops. 

The exploration ends with foreshadowing the next workshop which focuses on reproducible research by kniting the .Rmd into a HTML file, and sharing the code which will be interpreted by others.
