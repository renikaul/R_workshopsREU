The core tidyverse includes the packages that you're likely to use in everyday data analyses, such as [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for data visualization and [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) for data wrangling. You'll focus on these two in this session.


You can execute chunks by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter* or *Ctrl+Shift+Enter* on Windows. 

#3. Introduction to tidyverse

The tidyverse is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share common data representations and API design. The `tidyverse` package is designed to make it easy to install and load core packages from the tidyverse in a single command.

Code using tidyverse syntax starts with `data` and is followed by one or more `verbs` to be done to the data. The data and verbs are linked together using `%>%` which is called pipe. You can type out the pipe operator or using the shortcut *Cmd+Shift+M*.  

To get an overview of your data, use the function "summary":

```{r message = FALSE}
# Summary titanic
summary(passengers)
```

Now do the same using a pipe, one of the handiest tools in the tidyverse:

```{r message = FALSE}
# Summarize titanic using a pipe
passengers %>%
  summary()

```

#Other useful information

You may have noticed stylistic consistency in the code that we've written above. That's because we're adhering to a style guide. In data science *and* programming/coding in general, it's important to get accustomed to using a style guide asap. As Hadley Wickham puts it in the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/index.html),

Part I of the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/index.html) would be most useful for beginners.
