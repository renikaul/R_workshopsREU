 1. Approach to visualization
========================================================

Visualizations are useful for **data exploration** and **presentation**. 

Characteristics of data exploration visualizations 
  * complex
  * minimally annotated
  * potentially pattern-less 

should be avoided for presentation visualizations. 

Presentation visualizations
========================================================
 should guide the reader through the research.

Presentation visualizations
========================================================

We've spent a bit of time making figures for exploration, but haven't touched on presentation quality visualizations. 

**What are some characteristics of a good presentation visualization?**

2. Review of ggplot
========================================================  
 plots are divided into 3 fundamental parts
 
 **plot = data + Aesthetics + geometry**

Minimium arguements  
========================================================

Using the ggplot2 cheat sheet
========================================================  

The cheat sheet reads like a choose your adventure book. 
![](figs/gg_adventure1.png)

***
1. Based on your data, go to the One, Two or Three variables section.

***
1. Based on your data, go to the One, Two or Three variables section. 
2. If Two Variables decided if x and y are continuous.

1. Based on your data, go to the One, Two or Three variables section. 
2. If Two Variables decided if x and y are continuous. 
2. Start you ggplot based on the example given under the heading

1. Based on your data, go to the One, Two or Three variables section. 
2. If Two Variables decided if x and y are continuous. 
2. Start you ggplot based on the example given under the heading 
4. Add `geom_function` and additional aesthetic mapping as needed

***
1. Based on your data, go to the One, Two or Three variables section. 
2. If Two Variables decided if x and y are continuous. 
2. Start you ggplot based on the example given under the heading 
4. Add `geom_function` and additional aesthetic mapping as needed 
5. Repeat last step until finished. 

3. Plotting challenge
========================================================  
Often, you'll have an idea of the visualization you'd like to make. 

**But how to get there?**





***

![](figs/figure_sketch.jpg)

practice (*and google*) 

3. Plotting challenge
========================================================  

For the visualization exercises you'll work with the people sitting in your row. 

* Open `W4_Exercise/DataViz/DataViz_X.html` with the number corresponding to your row.
* Complete the 2 challenges as a group. (*this is a chance to practice starting a new project*)
    + Every group has the same 1$^{st}$ challenge, but different 2$^{nd}$ challenge
    + When you're finished, practice explaining your Challenge 2 code.
* We'll shuffle groups and explain the solutions to eachother. 


If you finish early, add more details to the plots or try exporting as a .png. 

3. Plotting challenge
========================================================  

**What were some of the interesting things you learned?**

========================================================  

 <h1> *Break* </h1>
  
When you come back we'll be switching gears to inferential statistics


4. Inferential statistics
========================================================  

is the branch of statistics that deals with hypothesis tests.


`R` **is much better for inferential statistics than other software** 

*why?*

Strength of R for statistics
========================================================  
`R` **is much better for inferential statistics than other software** 

* many of the common statistical analyses already exist as part of libraries
* code based analysis means modifications to analysis are recorded
* ...

Practice using inferential statistics
========================================================  
You learn what you need. 


5. Revisit work flow: scripts
========================================================  


6. Wrap Up
========================================================

**We canâ€¦**
- code using best practices
- create an HTML doc with code and commentary  
- write a function
- create and use scripts
- <span style="color:gray"> calculate summary statistics of a dataset </span>
- <span style="color:gray"> create a figure from data </span>
